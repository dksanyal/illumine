#Illumine: a tool for augmenting the National Digital Library of India

Illumine is designed as a chrome extension that finds an open full text for any research paper opened in the National Digital Library of India(DLI). The extension remains in standby mode until the user navigates to a document in NDLI. If the document is a research paper and not freely accessible in the current page, the extension attempts to find to locate an alternative full text. If an open access full text of the research paper is available, the user can simply click the extension button to open it in a new tab. If not, the extension button redirects to Google Scholar \cite{scholar}. %Figure \ref{Fig1} presents the statechart diagram detailing the procedure.
